# 32Blit Boilerplate

![Build](https://github.com/32blit/32blit-boilerplate/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This is a basic template for starting 32blit projects. It shows the basic
code layout and asset pipeline, hopefully giving folk a starting point for
any new projects.

It's based on the original `template` project from the 
[32Blit Beta](https://github.com/pimoroni/32blit-beta), with added asset
handling, and some tidying up to fit in with how I do things.

## Usage

[Use this template](https://github.com/32blit/32blit-boilerplate/generate) to
generate your own project.

* Edit the CMakeList.txt file to set the name of your project
* Edit the metadata.yml file to set the information for your project
* Edit the LICENSE file to set your name on the license
* Write lots of super cool code!

You should then be able to follow the usual build instructions.
